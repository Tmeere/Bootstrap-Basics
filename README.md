In this project I looked at teting some basic HTML & Bootstrap functions into the project, this includes using:

Containers and Fluid Containers
Creating an basic input form into the project with required validation
A custom formatted button with one being only viewable at certain sizes 
And a table with some cusrtom Bootstrap functionality
